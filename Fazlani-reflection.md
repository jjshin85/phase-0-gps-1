   #GPS Reflection 1.1

    What git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
    I was having trouble with navigating through certain git commands, making and modifying changes and then resubmitting them to Github, as well as merging my pull requests to my master branch in Github.

    What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
    I feel everything that I was struggling with going into the session was clarified. I was able to develop a better understanding of git commands, learned how to resubmit changes to Github, and also figured out why I was having trouble merging my branches to master on Github, as well as how to fix issues when there are merge conflicts.

    What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
    I asked many questions to both my pair and guide. I asked about the practical uses of pull requests, whether or not merge conflicts are something that are common or more rare. Also, I asked about certain tips on how to make usage of the terminal easier, such as how to save my password and username in the terminal.

    What still confuses you about git?
    While most of my issues with git have been resolved, I still have issues now and again entering the wrong command or accidentaly merging my master when I did not intend to. I believe as I become more comfortable with git and Github, respectively, I will no longer have these issues.

    How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?

    It was great! I really loved working with both my pair and my guide. I learned a lot about git and Github that I did not know or was confused about going into the session. I really felt that each and everyone was invested and the guide was very informative whenever we asked questions or tips. It was comforting knowing that my pair was also having similar problems which showed me that it is a part of the process for everyone when getting familiar with git and Github.
